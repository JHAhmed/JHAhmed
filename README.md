### Hey!
I'm a computer science bachelor's student at [Indian Institute of Technology Madras, Chennai](https://study.iitm.ac.in/ds/).
I have broad interests in front-end development and AI integrations. You can find me working on internships and studying by day, and scripting and coding away on personal projects by night.
If you think our interests align, do reach out!
